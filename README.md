1. A description of the treebank and its origin (creation method, data sources, etc.)
2. A description of how the data was split into training, development and test sets
3. If there are multiple genres/domains, can they be told apart by sentence ids? Does the treebank consist of complete documents, or just randomly shuffled sentences?
4. Acknowledgments and references that should be cited when using the treebank
5. A changelog section for treebanks that will be released for the second (or subsequent) time.
